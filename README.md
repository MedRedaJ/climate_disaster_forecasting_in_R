# Climate Disaster Time Series Forecasting using R

This project is a collaboration between me, Mohamed Reda Jahouri, [Justin Hay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinhay1/), and Tijn

This project consists of time series model analysis and comparison to identify trends and patterns in U.S. climate disasters.

This project aims to model the count of climate disasters as well as the cost over both a monthly and yearly time frame.

## Project Abstract
Each year, climate/disasters such as droughts and hurricanes affect millions of people in the United States. Understanding the nature of climate disasters and potentially predicting their frequency and cost would directly benefit key stakeholders such as locally impacted economies and insurance companies. The analysis conducted in the report is broken down into monthly and yearly timeframes, which allowed us to examine both local seasonality and forecast multi-year trends. In addition, both frequency and costs of disasters over both time periods were examined, with the intention of gaining a better understanding of the patterns belonging to both variables as well as their correlation to each other. Overall, the monthly analysis found that there is a strong seasonality in the summer months that is increasing over time, and there is a large spike of costs in the late summer due to tropical cyclones. The yearly analysis found that both counts and costs are increasing steadily over time, although it will take further analysis and data to be able to properly analyze costs specifically.
